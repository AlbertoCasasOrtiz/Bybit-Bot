Liquidation Hunter is a little bot written in Python that looks at
the liquidation feed via the Bitmex API for larger liquidation events
and counter trades them on Bybit where there is ZERO API friction and
we are able to get orders in very quickly without over load.

The theory is to trade very volatile moves when there are liquidations
present and get in quickly with a market order and use a tight Take Profit 
and Stop Loss. (Ride the Wave Dudddde)
